## Overview

An operating system (OS) is a critical layer of software that manages hardware resources and that provides user programs with a *simple and consistent* interface to the machine. In this course, we will examine the services and abstractions commonly provided by operating systems, and we will study the underlying mechanisms used to implement them. Topics include
+ processes and threads; scheduling of CPUs
+ access to shared resources: synchronization, concurrency, deadlocks, hazards
+ memory management and the memory hierarchy
+ storage and file systems
+ distributed systems, and
+ virtualization.

A good understanding of OS internals offers benefits, whether you intend to work in computer hardware or computer software. 
+ By understanding how an OS works, and making good/efficient use of its abstractions (files, memory), *you will be able to write better software*.
+ *The techniques that you learn here will have applications in every kind of computer system*. The traditional problems that occur in operating systems (like scheduling, synchronization, and resource management) also occur in all sorts of other hardware/software systems, ranging from small embedded computers to large scale cloud computing systems. 

The concepts presented in class will be explored through **six intensive programming assignments**. The assignments will make use of the C programming language, which the universal language for implementing and accessing operating systems at their lowest level. The projects will give you ample practice with manipulation of pointers, managment of memory, invoking of system services, and dealing with error conditions. The prof and the GTA will offer some technical guidance on these matters --- but **you should expect to spend significant time debugging, consulting reference materials, and revising the projects until they work properly**. There is no way around this requirement, so please budget the time needed to master the assignments.

The learning goals for students in this course are:
- Students will understand the abstractions and services provided by an operating system.
- Students will demonstrate that understanding through implementation of software employing the abstractions and services.
- Students will gain practical experience using and implementing operating system services.

The course materials will test each student's achievement of these goals at several levels. For each topic in the course, students must be able to:
- Describe traditional operating system structures and algorithms.
- Demonstrate in detail how they apply to various programs and data.
- Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of related structures and algorithms.
- Propose and evaluate a variety of improvements upon traditional methods.
- Implement basic methods in a working computing system.

## Course Communications

The course web site contains an `index.md` page containing the schedule, assignments, and other critical information: [https://github.com/patrick-flynn/CSE34341-SVS-Sp2023/blob/main/index.md](https://github.com/patrick-flynn/CSE34341-SVS-Sp2023/blob/main/index.md)

Canvas will be used as the class gradebook:

## Textbooks

- Required: Remzi H. Arpaci-Dusseau and Andrea C. Arpaci-Dusseau, **Operating Systems in Three Easy Pieces**, Arpaci-Dusseau Books, 2019. [http://ostep.org](http://ostep.org)

- Suggested Reference: Kernighan and Ritchie, The C Programming Language, Prentice-Hall, 1988.

## Reading Assignments

The textbook provides the foundation of the course, and it will be important for you to absorb it thoroughly.  To encourage regular reading and preparation for class, **you are required to turn in summary notes on the assigned readings each Monday of the semester by 11:59PM Pacific Time**. Notes will not be required on the March 13 (spring break) or April 10 (Easter Monday).  You will upload these notes in Canvas.  The easiest way to do this is just take notes on paper, and then snap a few photos for upload.  If you prefer to type them out, do so and attach a PDF or plain text file.

Your notes can be organized in whatever way is appropriate to that chapter and is useful for you. Good things to include may be an outline of the chapter, definition of key terms, a sketch of the systems or data structures being discussed, _etc._  **As part of your notes, you should submit one thoughtful question you would like to discuss that week**. The prof will try to raise a few of these questions each week as part of lectures.

Grading on notes will be very simple: 1.0, 0.5, or 0.0 points. One assignment with the lowest grade will be dropped for each student (but only one - if you get two 0.0 grades, one of them will still count).  Late submissions (with a Canvas submission time after Monday at 11:59PM Pacific time will earn a maximum of one-half point.

## Attendance

To succeed in this class, you should attend and actively participate in all the scheduled lectures. You will get the most out of class if you have done the required readings in advance and actively take notes during class.  Re-articulating, through writing, of the concepts in lecture and readings is essential to your "fixing" the material in your memory.

Please refrain from using your laptops for non-class activities, since this [tends to distract others](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2018/07/27/class-cellphone-and-laptop-use-lowers-exam-scores-new-study-shows) as well as yourself.

## Grading

The course grade will be based on reading notes, six programming projects, two homework assignments, a midterm exam, and a final exam. For each assignment, a numeric grade will be assigned. Grades will be made available in Canvas. Projects and homeworks are 60% of the course grade, the chapter notes are 10%, and the midterm and final exam are each 15%. At the end of the semester, number grades will be converted to letter grades: 90/80/70 are the usual cutoffs for A/B/C grades, respectively. The instructor will exercise discretion on borderline grades, or to account for a trend of increasing/decreasing grades throughout the semester.

If you believe an error has been made in grading an item, please bring it to the attention of the instructor within seven days of receiving it. Factual and clerical errors will of course be cheerfully corrected. After seven days, graded items are final and will not be revisited.

Late assignments and projects will not be accepted.  However, each student may use **one "late pass"** for one assignment or project (except Project 6) during the semester.  To use your late pass, **you must email the instructor prior to the deadline**.  The late pass will give you an extension of one week on the assignment or project.  A late pass cannot be used for the final assignment.  You have one late pass **total** - not one for an assignment and one for a project.

## Health and Safety

At the time of writing, classes are to be conducted in person normally and students are expected to attend all classes. You will see a higher rate of mask-wearing in Palo Alto than you have seen in South Bend. You are encouraged to have a mask with you in case you visit establishments or encounter that require/encourage masking.
Please comply with any public health requirements announced by the local government or the University (e.g., re-imposition of a mask mandate, etc.). If you have a mild illness (or are required to quarantine as a precaution) then you should work with your classmates to capture lecture notes you missed, and continue to complete assignments in the ordinary way. Office hours will be available by Zoom if needed.  **If you have a more serious illness, you are expected to visit local healthcare and provide documentation of the visit**, and your recovery process/timing must be discussed with the instructor so that alternate arrangements to make up material can be developed.

## Academic Code of Honor

As a student at Notre Dame, you are bound by the Academic Code of Honor (http://honorcode.nd.edu), which states:

> As a member of the Notre Dame community, I acknowledge that it is my responsibility to learn and abide by principles of intellectual honesty and academic integrity, and therefore I will not participate in or tolerate academic dishonesty.

The purpose of the homeworks and assignments in this course is for each student to gain the discipline and skills in design, programming, and analysis, so that they will be able to work independently in a professional setting. To that end, **all exams, homeworks, and programming assignments are to be completed individually. Each student must write their own code from scratch with their own hands based on their own understanding of the course material.**

You may consult with other students and outside resources in order to better understand concepts and techniques, or to debug localized problems. You may not copy -- and should refrain from viewing -- code from another student or resource, excepting any starter code provided by the instructor.

## Some Campus Resources

If you require an accommodation for a disability, please first contact the Sara Bea Center (sarabeadisabilityservices.nd.edu) for a consultation, and we will be happy to work together on a solution. If you encounter a difficult life situation and don't know what to do, please contact Dierre Upshaw who can help with an appropriate referral.
